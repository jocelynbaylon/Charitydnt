                We encourage support for those affected by disasters and those in orphanages. Our mission is to help society by providing education, healthcare, and addressing poverty and equality.<br>
                A charity foundation is a non-profit organization established to support and fund causes that benefit the public or specific communities.
                It typically raises money through donations, grants, and fundraising events, and allocates these funds to initiatives focused on areas such as education, 
                healthcare, poverty alleviation, environmental conservation, and more. The goal of a charity foundation is to make a positive impact on society by addressing social issues, 
                supporting vulnerable populations, and promoting community well-being.
